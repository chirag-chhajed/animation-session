When thinking about animation **duration**, donâ€™t just consider how long it takesâ€”think about how it will be **perceived**. Even a difference of 100ms can make an animation feel either snappy and responsive or slow and frustrating.

> You should generally keep your animations fast.

## Animation Overload

It's easy to get carried away and start adding animations everywhere. While this might seem like a good idea at first, it often leads to **overstimulation**. When animations are too frequent or unnecessary, they **lose their impact**.

Instead, we should **pace the user** through the experience. Use animation selectivelyâ€”especially in places where it **enhances the content** or **guides the userâ€™s attention**.

## Purpose: Adding Context

The **main goal** of most animations should be to **add context**.

A useful way to evaluate whether an animation is meaningful is to try and **describe what benefit** it provides to the overall experience.  
If it's easy to answer that, then your animation likely adds valuable context.

- Incorporate the animations users **expect**â€”like **enter and exit transitions**.
- Then **sprinkle in a few well-crafted moments** that provide clarity, emotion, or delight.

But crucially, the **quantity and quality** must be carefully considered.

> Animations must be **tasteful and elegant**.  
> Even highly polished animations can become tiring if they're overused or unnecessary.
