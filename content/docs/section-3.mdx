CSS animations are that are created with transition, keyframes. spring animations are not possible with CSS.

[CSS Articles](https://css-articles.com/)

## Use **CSS Animations** When:

- You need a **simple hover effect**.  
  > Example: button color change or slight scaling on hover.

- You need to **animate an element in or out**.  
  > Example: fade-ins, slide-ins, or basic entrance/exit animations.

- You have an **infinite, linear animation** like a **marquee**.  
  > Example: text scrolling horizontally across the screen.

- You are working on a **bundle-size sensitive project**.  
  > CSS animations are baked into the browser and add no additional JavaScript weight.

## Use **Framer Motion** (or other animation libraries) When:

- You need to create **complex animations**.  
  > Example: coordinated animations between multiple elements, dynamic transitions based on user interactions.

- You want to make your animations feel **more sophisticated and polished**.  
  > Example: smooth choreographed sequences, parallax effects, layout animations.

- You want your animations to be **interruptible** and **feel natural**.  
  > Example: a user dragging an element, changing its motion mid-animation without glitches.

Use CSS when the animation is **simple** and **structural**.  
Use libraries like Framer Motion when the animation is **dynamic**, **interactive**, or **needs fine control**.

## Clip Paths

clip path is a css property that allows to clip shapes or trimming a DOM node into specific shapes, like triangles.

### Cool stuff you can do with clip path

#### Split Text

<SplitText/>

How this effect works? you make two texts elements and make them overlap each other. Then you use clip path to clip the text into 50% of the height of the element.
then you use the mouse move event to change the clip path of the element based on the mouse position.

```tsx
export const SplitText = () => {
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState(50);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
      const y = (e.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 100;
      setMousePosition(Math.min(Math.max(y, 0), 100));
    };

    window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="relative py-10 flex items-center justify-center text-6xl font-bold">
      <div
        className="absolute text-sky-400"
        style={{
          clipPath: `inset(0 0 ${100 - mousePosition}% 0)`,
        }}
      >
        REALLY COOL TEXT
      </div>
      <div
        className="absolute text-sky-800"
        style={{
          clipPath: `inset(${mousePosition}% 0 0 0)`,
        }}
      >
        REALLY COOL TEXT
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
